        <p>
          I am a Full-Stack Web Developer, working professionally in the field
          since March 2021. I enjoy generating new ideas and developing viable
          solutions to widely relevant problems. Throughout my career I went
          through several challenges that made me progress and learn quickly, so
          I always try to pass my knowledge on, teaching as many people as
          possible!
