                    My name is Breno Alvim, I'm 20 years old. I work with web development since March 2021. I enjoy generating new ideas and developing viable solutions to broadly relevant problems. Throughout my career I went through several challenges that made me progress and learn quickly, so I always try to pass my knowledge on, teaching as many people as possible.
